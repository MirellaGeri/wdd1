        <p>Let me introduce myself. My name is Mirella and I am from Peru. I live in Lima with my mother, my sister, and my two cats.</p>
        <p>I love listening to the music of the youth channel of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints called Strive to Be. I started to learn to play ukulele and I became better.</p>
        <p>I hope to gain more knowledge and to be closer to Jesus Christ and His gospel.</p>
        <p>I will share all will learn this semester with my family and the young in the church.</p>
